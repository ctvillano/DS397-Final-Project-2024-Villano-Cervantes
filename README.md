## Binary Classification

### Loan Default Prediction: A Neural Network Approach

This project demonstrates how to build a basic neural network and apply it to a real-world dataset for predicting loan defaults.

### Data

We use a dataset from Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending company. The dataset contains various features that describe the loans issued by the company.

### Neural Network Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 22 features
- **Hidden Layer**: 1 fully connected layer with (2/3) * input_features nodes
- **Output Layer**: 1 fully connected layer with 1 output node using the sigmoid activation function

### Optimizer

The optimizer used in this project is Mini Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

### Loss Function

For binary classification, we use **Binary Crossentropy** as the loss function.

where \( y \) is either \( 0 \) or \( 1 \), and \( p \) is the predicted probability.
